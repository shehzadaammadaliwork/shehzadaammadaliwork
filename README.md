### JavaScript Code Generation & Validation LLM
  *Trained an LLM to generate, debug, and optimize JavaScript code for diverse use cases (web apps, APIs, Node.js). As an LLM Trainer, I curated datasets of real-world JS scenarios, authored high-quality code samples, and iteratively refined model outputs for accuracy and security. Key contributions included identifying and correcting edge cases (e.g., async/await pitfalls, callback hell), mitigating vulnerabilities (XSS, prototype pollution), and optimizing code efficiency (memory leaks, event-loop bottlenecks). The model now delivers production-ready JavaScript solutions aligned with modern best practices.*

### Vision-Driven Function Calling for LLMs
  *Engineered an SFT pipeline to train an LLM in interpreting visual inputs and autonomously invoking external APIs/tools via structured JSON calls. As an AI Trainer, I designed multimodal prompts combining images (e.g., graphs, invoices, maps) with user queries, teaching the model to extract visual data (numbers, locations) and trigger context-aware tool usage (payment processing, weather APIs, live data fetching). Responsibilities included curating function schemas, validating JSON outputs against image context, and refining the model‚Äôs ability to chain API responses into coherent final answers. The system now solves complex, real-time tasks (e.g., ‚ÄúCalculate shipping costs from this warehouse photo‚Äù) beyond standard LLM capabilities.*

### 

- **Role and Responsibilities**  
  As a senior software engineer for the Clause Generation project, my responsibilities included implementing and optimizing the clause generation pipeline, model training, and evaluation.

- **Challenges Faced**  
  1. ***LLMs too large for available GPU memory***  
     <b>Challenge: </b> The LLMs used in the project were too large to fit in the available GPU memory, which posed significant challenges in both model training and inference phases.  
     <b>Solution: </b> Conducted testing using EC2 g5.2xlarge instances, which provided sufficient GPU memory and computational power for efficient model training and inference. Implemented quantization techniques to reduce the model size, enabling it to fit within the available memory constraints. This involved converting the model to a lower precision format, significantly reducing the memory footprint without compromising performance.

  2. ***Maintaining model performance after quantization***  
     <b>Challenge: </b> Quantizing the model to fit within memory constraints could potentially degrade its performance, particularly in terms of accuracy and output quality.  
     <b>Solution: </b> Evaluated the performance of quantized models using syntax and semantic similarity metrics to ensure that the generated clauses maintained high-quality standards. Performed iterative fine-tuning and optimization to balance model size and performance, ensuring that the quantized models produced outputs comparable to their full-precision counterparts.

  3. ***Ensuring efficient prompt engineering***  
     <b>Challenge: </b> Effective prompt engineering is critical for guiding the LLMs to generate accurate and contextually appropriate legal clauses.  
     <b>Solution: </b> Developed and tested various prompt templates to determine the most effective configurations for eliciting high-quality clause generation from the LLMs. Conducted extensive experimentation with different prompt structures and contextual inputs, continuously refining the approach based on output quality and relevance.

  4. ***Integrating multiple frameworks (Llama and Falcon)***  
     <b>Challenge: </b> Utilizing multiple frameworks like Llama and Falcon for specific functionalities added complexity to the integration and coordination of different components within the project.  
     <b>Solution: </b> Designed a modular architecture that allowed for seamless integration of different frameworks, ensuring that each component could be developed and tested independently before integration. Conducted thorough interoperability testing to identify and resolve any compatibility issues between the frameworks, ensuring smooth and efficient operation of the entire clause generation pipeline.

  5. ***Managing computational resources for development and testing***  
     <b>Challenge: </b> Developing and testing the clause generation pipeline required significant computational resources, which could be challenging to manage, especially during local development.  
     <b>Solution: </b> Adopted a hybrid development environment where resource-intensive tasks were offloaded to cloud-based EC2 instances, while local development and testing utilized optimized, quantized models. Implemented a robust scheduling and resource management system to ensure efficient utilization of computational resources, minimizing downtime and maximizing productivity.
